# tabstate-parser

The TabState Parser is a Python script designed to parse the content of "bin" files generated by the native Notepad auto-save feature in Windows 11. This feature allows users to recover their notes even after a crash or system reboot. The files are stored in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsNotepad_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState`.
